title: New Site Launched!
---
Welcome to my new site. It's been a very long time since I have shared my knowledge on a regular basis. I've gathered lots of knowledge and wanted to share. If you want to know more about me you can learn about me in my [about](http://jtstroup.com/about/) page.

Hopefully, I can share something of value to you from my posts.

## This site
In case you are interested this site is running:
* HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
* [Jekyll] (https://jekyllrb.com/),
* Code is on [GitHub](https://github.com)
* Running with [netlify] (http://netlify.com)

## Dev Environment
Because I am now doing frontend development I use Sublime & Atom for my IDE on Windows 8 and 10. I have worked in other environments, Linux (Cyber security), MacOS. But I like to game from time-to-time and Windows becomes my top platform. If you're interested in more of the technologies, take a look at the links.

Hopefully, looking forward to providing insights and giving back to the community in the future.

Respectfully,

Joshua
